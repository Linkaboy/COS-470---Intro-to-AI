/****************************************
Write your code below. Think of the
play/0 predicate as the main() function.
It should start the simulation. When
play/0 is called, the simlation should
do the following:

- Move to one of the things and take it.
- Move to the next and take it.
- Move to the third and take it.
- Move to the gate.

Hints:
- Don't hard-code the solution. When I test
your code, I will rearrange a
few connections and a thing or two. If you
hard-code your solution, it will not work
when I test it.
- I will NOT change the names of the rooms
or things. Your code can assume fact names
stay the same.
- The gate will always be the exit.
- The player will always start in the kitchen.
- Your code must programmatically
find the correct path to each thing and
then to the gate.
- I suggest you create a cleanup/0 predicate
that uses retract or retractall, to reset
the simulation back to its initial state;
otherwise, facts created during previous
runs will persist.

All of the above should happen automatically
when the play/0 predicate is called.

Once the player has all three things and is
in the gate location, the win condition will
be true.
